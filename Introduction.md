### Data science can involve:

Statistics, computer science, mathematics + Data cleaning and formatting + Data visualization

An Economist Special Report sums up this melange of skills well - they state that a data scientist is broadly defined as someone:

#### “who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician and storyteller slash artist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data”

##### As big dat is rising at a tremendous rate from Social media like fb, insta, whatsapp, signal, tiktok, twitter, linkedin, youtube, emails, google searches, food and cab startups,  we have rich data and the tools to analyse it: Rising computer memory capabilities, better processors, more software and now, more data scientists with the skills to put this to use and answer questions using this data! Data is the gold mine for these industries.

### What is big data?
#### Big data can be defined as larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources There are a few qualities that characterize big data. 
The first is volume. As the name implies, big data involves large datasets. For example, say you had a question about online video - well, YouTube has approximately 300 hours of video uploaded every minute and results of big data class! You would definitely have a lot of data available to you to analyse, but you can see how this might be a difficult problem to wrangle all of that data!

Velocity. Data is being generated and collected faster than ever before. In our YouTube example, new data is coming at you every minute! In a completely different example, say you have a question about shipping times or routes. Well, most transport trucks have real time GPS data available - you could in real time analyse the trucks movements. commecting and growing social media accounts is faster than ever.

The third quality of big data is variety. Its available in structured as well as in unstructured form. In the examples I’ve mentioned so far, you have different types of data available to you. In the YouTube example, you could be analysing video or audio, which is a very unstructured data set, or you could have a database of video lengths, views or comments, which is a much more structured dataset to analyse.


## What is data?

Dictionary says data is Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.
Data is defined as statiscally as a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.

It is “a set of values” - to have data, you need a set of items to measure from. In statistics, this set of items is often called the population. The area we take into account for our understanding is called sample space.

The next thing to focus on is “variables” - variables are measurements or characteristics of an item. For example, you could be measuring the height of a person, or you are measuring the amount of time a person stays on a website. On the other hand, it might be a more qualitative characteristic you are trying to measure, like what a person clicks on on a website, or whether you think the person visiting is male or female.

Qualitative variables are, unsurprisingly, information about qualities. They are things like country of origin, sex, or treatment group. They’re usually described by words, not numbers, and they are not necessarily ordered. Quantitative variables on the other hand, are information about quantities. Quantitative measurements are usually described by numbers and are measured on a continuous, ordered scale; they’re things like height, weight and blood pressure.



#### Common types of messier data:
Sequencing data ; Population census data ; Electronic medical records (EMR), other large databases ;  Geographic information system (GIS) data (mapping) ; Image analysis and image extrapolation ; Language and translations ; Website traffic ; Personal/Ad data (eg: Facebook, Netflix predictions, etc)
