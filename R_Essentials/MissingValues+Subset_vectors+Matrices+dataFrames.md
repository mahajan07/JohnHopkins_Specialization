# Missing Value
- Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis. Often, missing values must not be ignored, but rather they should be carefully studied to see if there's an underlying pattern or cause for their missingness.
- To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing 1000 draws from a standard normal distribution with
- y <- rnorm(1000)
