#### R is both a programming language and an environment, focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics. R is downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN.

We are using R because : 
#### Popularity
R is quickly becoming the standard language for statistical analysis. This makes R a great language to learn as the more popular a software is, the quicker new functionality is developed, the more powerful it becomes, and the better the support there is! Additionally, as you can see in the graph below, knowing R is one of the top five languages asked for in data scientist job postings!

#### Cost
FREE! This one is pretty self-explanatory - every aspect of R is free to use, unlike some other stats packages you may have heard of (eg: SAS, SPSS), so there is no cost barrier to using R!

#### Extensive functionality
R is a very versatile language - Its use in stats and in graphing, but its use can be expanded to many different functions - from making websites, making maps using GIS data, analysing language… and even making these lectures and videos! For whatever task you have in mind, there is often a package available for download that does exactly that!

#### Community
And the reason that the functionality of R is so extensive is the community that has been built around R. Individuals have come together to make “packages” that add to the functionality of R - and more are being developed every day!

#### What is RStudio?
#### RStudio is a graphical user interface for R, that allows you to write, edit and store code, generate, view and store plots, manage files, objects and dataframes, and integrate with version control systems – to name a few of its functions. We will be exploring exactly what RStudio can do for you in future lessons, but for anybody just starting out with R coding, the visual nature of this program as an interface for R is a huge benefit. 

#### It has around 14000+ packages in the library under the big 3: CRAN, Github and bioInformatics which can be fornd under the name of big3 repositories.

### Usng R markdown or Git, we can make our text any way we want: Bold, italics, underline, html, bullets etc.
### We can run inline r code and even [links](yyfghh.com) too. Code chunks are made with ''' code ''' like this
